# Changelog

All notable changes to TurboCode are documented in this file.

The project follows Semantic Versioning while its public API and persisted
formats continue to evolve before 1.0.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Structured coordinator-to-worker task envelopes with bounded tools,
  verification, cancellation, recovery, and revision-aware results.
- Native Activity inspection for coordinator, worker, tool, verification, and
  terminal task state.
- Production coordinator routes for DeepSeek and Codex, with configurable
  Apple PCC, Llama, and DeepSeek workers.
- Deterministic release coverage for routing, delegation, approvals,
  cancellation, revision conflicts, verification, and on-device capability
  boundaries.

### Changed

- On-device work is restricted to a measured microtask capability envelope;
  broader coding requests remain with a capable worker or coordinator.
- Configuration and dynamic profiles migrate compatibly from the 0.1.0
  schema.

### Notes

- Apple PCC, at the moment, does not expose tool calls correctly through
  `fm serve`. PCC tool calling is deferred until Apple stabilizes the API
  contract; this limitation does not invalidate the rest of the release.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-29

Initial public preview.

### Added

- Native Codex profile backed by the official Codex App Server, including
  ChatGPT sign-in, model and reasoning selection, TurboCode tool bridging,
  approvals, token usage, and context handoff.
- On-device model statistics for latency, tokens, tool calls, and outcomes.
- Workspace `AGENTS.md` instruction discovery for repository-specific guidance.
- Structured Git status widget for staged, modified, and untracked files.
- Unified Swift Package Manager tool for package initialization, dependency
  management, resolution, updates, builds, tests, runs, cleanup, and inspection.
- Session Summary App Shortcut powered by the Apple on-device model.

### Improved

- Split the former monolithic chat store into focused conversation, workspace,
  timeline, runtime, review, and tool-interaction domains with regression tests.
- Refined remote-model guidance and product-scope instructions.
- Stabilized DeepSeek prompt-cache prefixes and added cache diagnostics.
- Expanded deterministic coverage for first launch, Codex, Swift Package
  Manager, Git presentation, workspace instructions, and chat architecture.

### Fixed

- Apply-edits patches now support workspace paths containing spaces.

### Notes

- TurboCode 0.1.0 targets macOS 27, Xcode 27, and Swift 6.
- Golden model evaluations remain experimental signals and are not release
  gates for this preview.
